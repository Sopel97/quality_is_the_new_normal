# Quality Is The New Normal

Scales most entities such that legendary variant matches old normal variant. Some things are unaffected due to balancing, or rarely due to no good way of scaling the other way. The list is as follows (copied from notes in the code):

```
Things left as is by design
   - robots - because they would be too bad to be workable at all
   - chests - because they don't really matter anyway
   - military - because biters are annoying as is in SA and it will be even worse with this mod
   - poles - because there's no way to scale them back and are not that important anyway
   - health - doesn't matter
   - equipment grid sizes - because it's just QoL
   - repair packs - because whatever
   - train fuels - because they are in a good state, though this is controversial, may change at some point
   - science value - because making quality science in the base game is not a good idea
   - thrusters - because you need a lot anyway, may change in the future
   - asteroid collectors - because there's no good way to scale them back, may change in the future
   - exoskeletons - because it's QoL
   - quality modules - because they are at a good point and lowering changes would completely derail this mod
   - drills - no good way of scaling them, might consider a constant multiplier if they end up being way too overpowered with the SA mining productivity research
